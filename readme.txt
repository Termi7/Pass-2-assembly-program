Description:
In this project, we have to perform the pass two assembler right after pass 1.
To complete this project you have to have a working pass 1 code and add the pass 1
to it. This project consists of reading the input files and creating and opening 
two new files which will serve as the output file. For every record, you read check the
different segments and keep track of symbols and make sure they are already in the symbolTable 
to make sure no new symbol is introduced. You have to keep track of the opcode value of each line and use it 
on your display. Your program will output two files one will display a list file with all different address values, symbols, codes, and opcode values
and the other one will display the object code.

Extra credit:
Yes I completed the extra credits

Experience: 
I had a lot of fun doing this project since it was a complement to the project we
did before. I learned a lot throughout the process like writing to a file and how to use advanced strings manipulation in C
doing the object code file was not easy since it require a lot of detail.

Shortcomings:
No shortcomings

Improvements: 
For Improvements, I will try to make my code more efficient to run faster
But other than that I did finish everything.
